#Zebrans Test


A technician test that implements an API with Clean architecture to interact with a catalog of products

### About this
This api is dockerized, it was created with the Flask python framework and the PostgreSQL database was used.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- docker: https://docs.docker.com/install/

- docker-compose: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

## How does it run?

First you need to clone this awesome project. Once cloned, inside your project folder run:

`docker-compose up -d`

Then run the following command, to initialize the database

`make db`

And voilÃ ! you will have the application working on:

- `make init_db` instead of __docker exec zebtest_api flask db init__
- `make migrate` instead of __docker exec zebtest_api flask db migrate__
- `make upgrade` instead of __docker exec zebtest_api flask db upgrade__
- `make db` to run init_db, migrate and upgrade at the same time
